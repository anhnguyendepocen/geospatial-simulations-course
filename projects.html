<h2>Projects</h2>
Throughout the semester, the students develop and
implement a geospatial simulation tool using one of the techniques covered by the
course with application in their study scientific domain. The development will be
performed incrementally over the course of the semester. First, students will identify a research question that
requires simulation of geospatial process or phenomena and exploration of system behavior under a selected set of
conditions. Second, students will be required to develop a methodological workflow and identify the appropriate
programming tools for implementation. Finally, the project culminates with a research presentation delivered to the
rest of the class at the end of the semester and a short paper. Documentation of the simulation tool and a live
demonstration will be required. The final design will be judged on methodological rigor, creativity, and presentation.
